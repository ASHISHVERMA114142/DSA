more detail solution here - https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-all-elements-to-zero/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-11-10
solution- so here we are maintaing the order of the element so basic understanding is here that if we get the value that is smaller or equeal then the current value then  
its is already handled by the previous occuring element so we have to take care of the new elements that is coming to us . but in this case we have to count the values that are 
requried in increate order only  
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Stack<Integer> st=new Stack<>();
        int ans=0;
        for(int val:nums){
            while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek()>val){
                st.pop();
            }
            if(val==0)continue;
            if(st.isEmpty() || st.peek()<val){
                ans++;
                st.push(val);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
