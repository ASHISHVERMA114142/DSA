## Introduction

The Two Pointer technique is a powerful algorithmic pattern that uses two pointers to traverse data structures, typically arrays or linked lists, to solve problems efficiently. It often reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

### When to Use Two Pointers?
- Problems involving sorted arrays
- Finding pairs/triplets with specific properties
- Partitioning arrays
- Sliding window problems
- Removing duplicates
- Reversing or rearranging elements

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Opposite Direction Pointers**
Two pointers start at opposite ends and move toward each other.

```
left →              ← right
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

**Use Cases:**
- Finding pairs with target sum in sorted array
- Palindrome checking
- Container with most water

### 2. **Same Direction Pointers (Fast & Slow)**
Both pointers move in the same direction at different speeds.

```
slow →    fast →
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

**Use Cases:**
- Removing duplicates
- Cycle detection
- Finding middle element
- In-place array modifications

### 3. **Sliding Window**
Two pointers maintain a window that slides through the array.

```
left →    right →
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    [window]
```

**Use Cases:**
- Subarray sum problems
- Longest substring problems
- Maximum/minimum in window

## Pattern Categories

### Pattern 1: Opposite Direction (Convergent)

**Template:**
```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    if (condition) {
        // Process and move pointers
        left++;
        // or right--;
    } else if (anotherCondition) {
        right--;
    } else {
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Same Direction (Fast & Slow)

**Template:**
```java
int slow = 0;
for (int fast = 0; fast < arr.length; fast++) {
    if (condition) {
        arr[slow] = arr[fast];
        slow++;
    }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Sliding Window (Variable Size)

**Template:**
```java
int left = 0, right = 0;
while (right < arr.length) {
    // Expand window
    addToWindow(arr[right]);
    
    // Shrink window if needed
    while (windowInvalid()) {
        removeFromWindow(arr[left]);
        left++;
    }
    
    // Update result
    updateResult();
    right++;
}
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern
- Is the array sorted? → Consider opposite direction
- Need to modify in-place? → Consider fast & slow
- Looking for subarray/substring? → Consider sliding window

### Step 2: Define Pointer Movement Rules
- What condition moves left pointer?
- What condition moves right pointer?
- When do we update the result?

### Step 3: Handle Edge Cases
- Empty array
- Single element
- All elements same
- No valid answer exists

### Step 4: Optimize
- Can we avoid extra space?
- Can we reduce comparisons?
- Are there early termination conditions?

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Three Pointers Pattern**

Used in problems like Dutch National Flag (Sort Colors).

```java
int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
while (mid <= high) {
    if (arr[mid] == 0) {
        swap(arr, low, mid);
        low++;
        mid++;
    } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
        mid++;
    } else {
        swap(arr, mid, high);
        high--;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Two Pointers on Two Arrays**

Used in merge operations or finding common elements.

```java
int i = 0, j = 0;
while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
    if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
        // Found common element
        i++;
        j++;
    } else if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
        i++;
    } else {
        j++;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Sliding Window with Hash Map**

For complex window validation.

```java
Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
int left = 0, right = 0;
while (right < s.length()) {
    char c = s.charAt(right);
    map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
    
    while (windowInvalid(map)) {
        char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
        map.put(leftChar, map.get(leftChar) - 1);
        if (map.get(leftChar) == 0) {
            map.remove(leftChar);
        }
        left++;
    }
    
    updateResult();
    right++;
}
```

### 4. **Fast & Slow Pointer (Floyd's Algorithm)**

For cycle detection in linked lists.

```java
ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    
    if (slow == fast) {
        // Cycle detected
        return true;
    }
}
return false;
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. **Off-by-One Errors**
```java
// ❌ Wrong: might miss last element
while (left < right - 1)

// ✅ Correct
while (left < right)
```

### 2. **Not Handling Duplicates**
```java
// In 3Sum, after finding a triplet:
while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
```

### 3. **Incorrect Window Shrinking**
```java
// ❌ Wrong: shrink only once
if (windowInvalid()) {
    left++;
}

// ✅ Correct: shrink until valid
while (windowInvalid()) {
    left++;
}
```

### 4. **Forgetting to Sort**
Many two-pointer problems require sorted input. Always check if sorting is needed.

### 5. **Integer Overflow**
When dealing with sums or products, watch for overflow:
```java
// Use long for large sums
long sum = (long) nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];
```
